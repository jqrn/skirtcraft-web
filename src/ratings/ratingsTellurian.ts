      "Super comfortable! Best skirt I ever wore! Very practical for everyday wear. Might have to get more so I can wear this model everyday. Only minor complaint is it's just a little time consuming to put on.",

      'A quality skirt. Construction seems very good. The fabric is a good weight.. It is really very comfortable. The pockets are quite important to me and a good size. And it is quite easy to put on and take off. Very pleased. Thanks very much!',

    review:
      "I've only worn this for one day as of writing, but I can 100% recommend it! I think I'm gonna prefer it over my Unaligned skirt, but that's primarily because I like the softer fabric compared to Unaligned's stiffer construction. It did shrink in the wash, so if you're on the fence between two sizes, you might want to get the larger of the two.",
