      'A quality skirt. Construction seems very good. The fabric is a good weight.. It is really very comfortable. The pockets are quite important to me and a good size. And it is quite easy to put on and take off. Very pleased. Thanks very much!',

    review:
      "I've only worn this for one day as of writing, but I can 100% recommend it! I think I'm gonna prefer it over my Unaligned skirt, but that's primarily because I like the softer fabric compared to Unaligned's stiffer construction. It did shrink in the wash, so if you're on the fence between two sizes, you might want to get the larger of the two.",

      'Got both the black and the white skirts. Both fit great, feel great, and look great. So well made and so comfortable. I’ve been a full-time casual kilt wearer for some time now. These are my first step into non-kilt skirts and I’m so happy to expand the repertoire. I already can’t wait to see what other colors and styles these folks come up with next.',

      "I appreciate Skirtcraft most for its utility and the fact that these skirts are truly unisex, having been designed for no particular body type. My current favorite is the Tellurian for its material weight, adjustability and range of motion. I'm so happy to have found this product--thank you ever so much!",
