    { review: 'I bought 2 of the unaligned skirts, I love the look with the angled front and rear seams; that feature changes the way the skirt hangs and moves and adds individuality to the design. The skirts arrived well packed in environmentally friendly envelopes filled with shredded recycled paper, potentially messy but not an issue if the envelopes are opened as intended. The skirts had been folded together with no tight bends to cause creasing so they were wearable straight out of the bag, or would have been had it not been for the instruction to wash and dry them before use (to finish shrinking to size). Both skirts did shrink slightly, as they should, but I would have preferred it had they shrunk a little more. The skirts have proved to be comfortable, if slightly generous in the waist measurement (an inch or so larger than the nominal size). However, the inclusion of plenty of belt loops means this is not a problem and the asymmetry of the design lends itself to an off-centre belt buckle, adding another nice visual difference to the skirts. In use, the top pockets have proved to be well positioned and sized and the two lower pockets are cavernous, almost too large when I\'m trying to get my phone before it stops ringing. The skirts are completely unrestrictive, allowing a full stride, even for me at 6\' 3\" tall, and the fabric weight means the skirt does not flap excessively in strong winds. The construction is first rate. I could not find a single loose or off-cut of thread nor untrapped end on either skirt and every stitch line runs straight & true with a perfectly even stitch length; something I cannot say about many clothes these days. Detailing is good with a neat logoed button and tidily integrated lower pockets. Pressing the skirt revealed that the upper pocket panels are a bit fiddly, but that is not a significant issue. The only thing stopping me buying a third skirt is that I\'ve run out of colours! How about making the skirt available in olive green?', name: 'Ian, Buckinghamshire, England', ratingStars: 5, date: '2015-12-07 00:00:00' },

Even if the skirt had not been exactly what I was looking for, the excellent service would have won me over. I can\'t say enough about how important that is - it often seems like a lost art, but it\'s in full force at Skirtcraft, with Joe leading the way. The actual skirt is even better than I was anticipating. The fit was just right for me, even after washing and drying (I always wash my cottons in cold and air dry the first two or three times before I wear it). It does get softer after washing - another plus. And I love the way it looks! Thanks.', name: 'Todd, Fairfield', ratingStars: 5, date: '2015-12-08 10:00:00' },

    { review: 'For a while I was asking myself why men are not wearing skirts when the Kickstarter project of Joe crossed my path. I immediately sustained the project. After shipping problems I finally received my skirt.  The quality is very good and it does look like something wearable for men. Comparing it with wearing my jeans, it is surprisingly comfortable and ergonomic. It does not have the tendency to sink down how simple it is to put your hands in the pockets!  The next step is outside... Chile is a super macho country, so I was warned to engage vocal, or even physical, encounters. At least my wife, who was skeptical, was enthusiastic about the look of it and assured me she doesn\'t have a problem walking next to me. The first comment was from a heavy metal loving young nephew: a skirt! Wow... Cool! After Xmas dinner with my family we discussed a little about \"why not?\" and all excepted.  Yesterday I came out of the car... and entered the local mall to go the supermarket, hand in hand with my wife. While everybody was looking at me I was looking at everybody. I don\'t think that I got more looks than what is normal because of a red beard, being milky white, wearing a tshirt with an \"Eco text\". And while looking myself I discovered that many fellow men or, even, women are looking at least as ridiculous I would. Or not at all! Later my wife told me that various people have been staring, but nobody made a \"not accepting grim\". My first day in public didn\'t bring any trouble, but surely I will get negative comments. And, while it is high summer here, my first day learned me as well that a skirt is a welcome ventilating piece of clothing.  The only things I never thought of: how to sit with a skirt on, how to stand up from the couch or how to step in and out of the car! My first day in public brings me back to my original question, but with a different meaning: why aren\'t men wearing skirts? Good idea Joe! I hope that more people will accept the skirt as a unisex garment.', name: 'Harry, Chile', ratingStars: 5, date: '2015-12-27 13:23:46' },
    { review: 'Pluses: This is a comfortable and sturdy-feeling skirt. I love having the deep pockets! It washes well in cold water, machine dry low. The color is a good dark black. It is good for casual wear or wear to work (my workplace is fairly casual). There are lots of belt loops where you can clip your keys or whatever.  Drawbacks: This skirt does show lint/pet hair easily. Use a sticky roller. The A-line shape does not fit perfectly over my curves. That\'s fine for me, but know that if you are curvy with large hips and slim waist, it will not lie smoothly on you.', name: 'Female, 45, Portland OR', ratingStars: 4, date: '2015-12-28 14:00:00' },

I have one of each color and I have washed them twice so far and the khaki shrank a little more than the black.  I have debated having one of them shortened.  I prefer a 20 inch length on a skirt.  But on these a 22.5\" length gives you just a little more coverage when sitting. So I am torn. The longer and fuller skirt is so comfortable but I don\'t like the look of it on me.  But for now they are staying long.  Keep up the good work.  I hope in the future we will see more unisex skirt designs come out.', name: 'Rich - PA', ratingStars: 5, date: '2016-01-19 04:32:18' },

    { review: 'As a male in late 20th century western civilization, I had no skirted options in my closet for most of my life. At an early age, a series of incidents caused me to learn to be extremely careful while zipping up my pants. I also became acclimated to the need to frequently \"adjust myself\" and, like most boys and men, not to even notice when I do it...or how frequently. At a certain point I just accepted that the sudden, sharp pains in the groin area due fabric binding against sensitive body parts that happen to be susceptible to just that were just an unavoidable reality. Long hours either driving or sitting at a desk in an office reveal the sinister twin problem: the dull, aching numbness that happens when the fabric binds you but you don\'t notice because it didn\'t cause the aforementioned sharp pain. You then hit middle age, and your doctor tells you that unless you can get some more ventilation down there, your risk of cancer and other issues increases. He suggests boxer shorts, but in practice, that just causes more cloth being stuffed into the same limited space and only makes things worse.  Then the aliens came. They laughed at me and called me stupid. They said that given human anatomy, men wearing pants and women wearing skirts was exactly backwards and until we wised up, there\'d be no joining the Planetary Federation for us...and that the invasive probing would continue.  Skirtcraft changed my life. I can sit at my desk for hours now and never be bothered by debilitating groin pain. And the comfort! Captain Malcolm Reynolds had it right, there\'s a whole airflow thing...particularly nice on a hot summer day. Alien encounters now happen in coffee shops over a nice double shot mocha rather than in sterile rooms equipped with cold, stainless steel equipment.  In short, my life is now rather awesome. Thank you, Skirtcraft! Definitely a five star company, if you ask me. And you did. Aren\'t you glad?', name: 'LRS, Central Virginia, USA', ratingStars: 5, date: '2016-02-08 05:17:25' },
